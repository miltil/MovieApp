# MovieApp

##Summary
This project is my submission for the popular movie viewing app for the Udacity Android Nanodegree.

This app creates a grid of the thirty most popular movies at the moment, sorted either by popularity or their rating. When a movie is clicked, further movie details are displayed, such as the release year, a synopsis, reviews, and viewable trailers.

##To Run
Before it can be run, this project requires that a valid API key be inserted in line 253 of MainActivityFragment and lines 223 and 366 of DetailActivityFragment. The API key can be requested from themoviedb.org after creating an account.
